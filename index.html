</picture><p>JOSHUA LEWIN   For Chef Josh Lewin, a career in the kitchen was arguably inevitable. Boston-bred with an expansive family, he was exposed early on to a variety of different kitchens and cooking styles including Italian, Romanian, and Austrian cuisines.
    Influenced early on by his paternal grandmother, he saw firsthand how one’s travels - in her case, France, Cuba, Africa, Japan - could inspire once back home. At just 12 years old, Josh began testing out his own recipes and even developed a menu and
    business plan for a bed & breakfast for the family home where he shared a bedroom with his younger brother.  While it didn't pan out, he rarely left the kitchen until, a few years later, he transitioned into a more professional kitchen. Beginning
    as a dishwasher, he quickly became a valuable member of the team and was promoted to line cook while in the middle of high school. Before long, he had redeveloped the dinner program and was managing full time. On the side, Josh took every opportunity
    he could to learn about food from around the world, taking lessons from exchange students from Spain, France, and Morocco, among others. Following high school graduation, Josh landed his first real apprenticeship at a family-run steakhouse in Connecticut,
    getting exposure to late-century Americanized fine dining staples. He also did some dairy farming and bartending, adding to his growing knowledge base. As his passion grew, so did his commitment to the field, and Josh staged with a number of highly
    regarded chefs and restaurants, including Charlie Trotter’s, No. 9 Park, Momofuku Noodle Bar, Craig on Main, Clio, and Uni Sashimi Bar. After completing service with the United States Marine Corps, Josh recommitted himself to a career in restaurants,
    inspired by the universal tradition and importance food has for all peoples across the globe. Landing back in Boston, he joined Beacon Hill Bistro as sous chef in 2010 and became executive chef just two years later. During this time, Josh and his
    partner, Katrina Jazayeri, began independently hosting a series of pop-ups and themed events, allowing them to celebrate their own personal favorite things. Thus, Bread & Salt Hospitality was born, and its great success and warm reception allowed
    the two to pursue the endeavor full time. Upon leaving Beacon Hill Bistro to pursue Bread & Salt Hospitality in 2014, Josh took to opportunity to stage twice more, this time with James Beard award-winning Vikram Sunderam at Rasika in Washington, DC.
    and Dominique Crenn at the two Michelin-star Atelier Crenn. In September 2014, Bread & Salt took the opportunity to open their first restaurant, the temporary "Bread & Salt at Wink & Nod" in Boston’s South End, ensuring the successful launch of an
    innovative program that now serves as a rotating culinary incubator program for local chefs & pop-ups. For seven months, Josh and his team oversaw the entire menu and kitchen while developing the concept for his own brick & mortar. Slated to open
    this fall, the 30 year old chef will introduce Juliet, the first freestanding entity under Bread & Salt Hospitality, to his Somerville, MA neighbors. KATRINA JAZAYERI   Born in Queens and raised in Austin, Katrina Jazayeri grew up surrounded by the
    romanticism of food.  With an Iranian father and an American mother brought together by food, she saw firsthand its ability to create relationships, specific memories, and lasting connections. Her parents met while working together in a restaurant
    and often told stories about mixing caesar salads and steak tartare table side, painting a picture of classic service and black tie waiters along with the notion of camaraderie within the industry. Frequent dinner parties solidified their status as
    the ultimate hosts, further exposing Katrina to  Despite this influence, Katrina moved across the country to study engineering and, later, healthcare inequalities at the University of California Santa Cruz, graduating in 2011 with a degree in social
    justice.  While working with public health non-profit organizations, it became clear just how important food and economic opportunity are to overall health and wellbeing. Katrina combines childhood memories with her education and post grad experience
    to create a career in food with a positive community influence.  In 2012, Katrina returned to the East Coast and joined Somerville-based Cuisine en Locale, a company that delivers meals created entirely with locally-grown ingredients and hosts special
    pop-up events. There, she produced innovative menus, cooked flavorful dishes while adhering to a strict sourcing philosophy, and assisted in the business’s expansion, buildout, and renovation of the old Anthony’s  Function Hall in Somerville.  While
    working with Cuisine en Locale, Katrina joined the team at Belly Wine Bar in Kendall Square as a server where, under the leadership of co-owner and mentor Liz Vilardi, she developed her palate and knowledge about wine. After one year, she rose to
    manager of Belly and sister restaurant - and Boston-area institution - The Blue Room. In this role, Katrina oversaw the operations of two concepts, cultivated relationships with staff and guests alike, and further developed her skill set. It was during
    this time that Katrina and her partner, Josh Lewin, began independently hosting a series of pop-ups and themed events, allowing them to celebrate their own personal favorite things. Thus, Bread & Salt Hospitality was born, and its great success and
    warm reception allowed the two to pursue the endeavor full time.  In September 2014, Bread & Salt took the opportunity to open their first restaurant, the temporary "Bread & Salt at Wink & Nod" in Boston’s South End, ensuring the successful launch
    of an innovative program that now serves as a rotating culinary incubator program for local chefs & pop-ups. For seven months, Josh oversaw the kitchen while simultaneously working with Katrina to develop the concept for their first freestanding entity,
    Juliet, slated to open this fall. At just 26 years old, Katrina is also the founder and designer of Post Oak, custom-made attractive yet functional aprons that are fast becoming a favorite of local chefs.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0

At just 12 years old, Josh began testing out his own recipes and even developed a menu and business plan for a bed & breakfast for the family home where he shared a bedroom with his younger brother.   While it didn't pan out, he rarely left the kitchen until, a few years later, he transitioned into a more professional kitchen.

Following high school graduation, Josh landed his first real apprenticeship at a family-run steakhouse in Connecticut, getting exposure to late-century Americanized fine dining staples. He also did some dairy farming and bartending, adding to his growing knowledge base.

It has a large height, short extenders, and a\ncompact width for better screen use, and economy of space.\n\nThe family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five\nweights and with smallcaps. Two italics — one will be called \"italic\", and\nthe other \"cursive\" — are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing\nsomething already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other\nuses.","links":["https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Neuton","https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/neuton"],"normal":4,"bold":7},"screen":{"$formality":-0.4545454545454546,"$type":["sans","humanist"],"$weight":2,"$width":2,"$xheight":2,"$contrast":2,"$caps":"normal","family":"Lato","name":"Lato","foundry":"google","license":"ofl","similar_to":["Freight Sans","Today Sans"],"description":"Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by\nWarsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish).

With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was\nconceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end\ndecided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became\navailable for a public
